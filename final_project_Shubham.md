### Part I: Final project

#### Summary for the Final Project

According to the National Institutes of Health, obesity related diseases are responsible for the second highest number of deaths in United States, second only to tobacco(1). It has also been studied that most of the obesity related deaths are related to high amount of fast-food consumption and lack of exercise.
Here I would like to visualise how obesity related diseases are the cause behind human deaths in United States and also understand what percentage of people in the United States are consuming fast-food on a daily basis, what categories of people consume most amount of fast-food and how it is affecting their health in the long run. With this I want to address everyone to reduce the consumption of fast-food and live a healthier and longer life.

#### Project Structure
a) Visualisation depicting total number of deaths in the United States and the reasons behind them. Here I would like to show how obesity related diseases are one of the major leading reasons behind the deaths. <br />
b) I would now continue this story by showing what percentage of poeple in United States consume fast-food on a daily basis, which is one of the most important reason behind obesity related diseases. <br />
c) Further continuing this story, I would like to show what categories of people in the United States are more inclined towards consuming fast-food on a daily basis. <br />
d) I want to tell a story how different factors affect fast-fooding eating habits of people in the United States and analyse and who should particularly be more conscious about eating more fast-food.

#### Initial Sketches / Wirefames
a) This pie-chart depicts the percentage of various causes of deaths in the United States

b) After the feedback in the class, I was suggested to use TreeMap instead of Pie-Chart, as it will make it more clear.

c)This bar graph depicts Percentage of adults aged 20 and over who consumed fast food on a given day, by sex and age: United States

d) This bar graph depicts Age-adjusted percentage of adults aged 20 and over who consumed fast food on a given day, by sex and race

<br />
Here I'll also be adding few more sketches to continue this story in final project.
<br />
<br />
To further these sketches, I want to tell a story how different factors affect fast-fooding eating habits of people in the United States and analyse and who should particularly be more conscious about eating more fast-food.

#### Data Sources for Visualisations
a) https://www.healthline.com/health/leading-causes-of-death <br />
I will be using this website to web-scrap the data related to deaths caused and the reasons behind it and use this data for my first visualisation. <br />
b) https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db322_table.pdf#page=1 <br />
I will be using this website to get the necessary information showing what percentage of poeple in United States consume fast-food on a daily basis and further categorise them into various categories.

#### Platform
I will be using Shorthand platform for my final project. I will be using multiple visualisations to form a story that I want to tell as I have mentioned above. <br />
I will also be using Tableau and FLourish to visualise the datasets and make various visualisations on the same. <br />
With the help of these visualisation, I plan to depict a story flow for the issue of fast-food consumption and obesity.

#### Project Completion Process
a) Data sources and the basic story line has been identified.<br />
b) Basic sketches / wireframes for the story have been created. <br />
c) Next step will be to show these sketches to multiple people and take their feedback to improve the skethces. <br />
d) Then I will be implementing these feedbacks in my sketches. <br />
e) Once the sketches have been identified, I will be using Tableau to finalise these visualisations digitally. <br />
f) Once the visualisations are finalised, I will be using Shorthand to make a presentation / story flow for the final project.
