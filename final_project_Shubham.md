### Part I: Final project

#### Summary for the Final Project

According to the National Institutes of Health, obesity related diseases are responsible for the second highest number of deaths in United States, second only to tobacco(1). It has also been studied that most of the obesity related deaths are related to high amount of fast-food consumption and lack of exercise.
Here I would like to visualise how obesity related diseases are the cause behind human deaths in United States and also understand what percentage of people in the United States are consuming fast-food on a daily basis, what categories of people consume most amount of fast-food and how it is affecting their health in the long run.
