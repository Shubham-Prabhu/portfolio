### Part I: Final project

#### Summary for the Final Project

According to the National Institutes of Health, obesity related diseases are responsible for the second highest number of deaths in United States, second only to tobacco(1). It has also been studied that most of the obesity related deaths are related to high amount of fast-food consumption and lack of exercise.
Here I would like to visualise how obesity related diseases are the cause behind human deaths in United States and also understand what percentage of people in the United States are consuming fast-food on a daily basis, what categories of people consume most amount of fast-food and how it is affecting their health in the long run.

#### Project Structure
a) Visualisation depicting total number of deaths in the United States and the reasons behind them. Here I would like to show how obesity related diseases are one of the major leading reasons behind the deaths. <br />
b) I would now continue this story by showing what percentage of poeple in United States consume fast-food on a daily basis, which is one of the most important reason behind obesity related diseases. <br />
c) Further continuing this story, I would like to show what categories of people in the United States are more inclined towards consuming fast-food on a daily basis.

#### Initial Sketches / Wirefames

#### Data Sources for Visualisations
a) https://www.healthline.com/health/leading-causes-of-death <br />
I will be using this website to web-scrap the data related to deaths caused and the reasons behind it and use this data for my first visualisation. <br />
b) https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db322_table.pdf#page=1 <br />
I will be using this website to get the necessary information showing what percentage of poeple in United States consume fast-food on a daily basis and further categorise them into various categories.

#### Platform
I will be using Shorthand platform for my final project. I will be using multiple visualisations to form a story that I want to tell as I have mentioned above.
