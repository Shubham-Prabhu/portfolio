#### Documentation explaining my process

Reason why I chose this visualisation:
While going through various news articles, I came across this one where when I saw the visualisation without reading the article, I had no idea what was going on in it. On the other hand, it was directly contradicting what the article's headline was saying. So I decided to choose this visualisation, where I can make a lot of changes.

The title of the article states that “America’s homeless population rises for first time in years”, but taking a first look at the visualization, it is not clear if the homeless population has increased or decreased as a lot of lines have been shown which can confuse the reader. Taking a closer look at the visualization, we can see that the US average was 17.3% in 2015, and it has dropped to 17% in 2017, indicating a decrease in the homeless population. which contradicts the headline of the article. So the visualization is rated lowest on the truthfulness scale.
Using the same colored lines to show both the increasing and decreasing rates of homelessness in various states is really hard to follow, especially in the lower section of the visualization where a lot of lines are intersecting with each other and creating chaos. That’s why the permeability scale and intuitiveness scale have been rated lower.
Writing names of the states and their rates on both axes really helps to understand if the homelessness rate has increased or decreased in that state, although the intersecting lines make it a bit confusing. So the data has been displayed in a good way, but the visualization is not.
The thing I would do differently is that I would find a way to avoid intersecting lines which will result in less confusion for the viewer. Also if possible, I would like to change the title of the article and change it to what data says.

Primary audiences for this visualization are the US citizens and the government of the country. The article and the visualization aims to educate its audience about the rising homelessness issue in the country and how it poses a problem. It also wants people to ask the government to act on it and try to solve this problem. 
The visualization does show a lot of right data in the wrong manner. The point of the article is to show how the rate of homelessness is increasing in the country and how the top 10 states with the highest homelessness ratio are seeing an increase in this problem. Unfortunately, the data visualization is very confusing in the sense that it is too crowded and the viewer is unable to identify the pattern that the article wants to show. Also, the total rate of homelessness according to the data has actually decreased in the country, contradicting the title of the article. So the headline and the visualization really confuse the reader as to what to focus on. Hence overall, the visualization is not effective for reaching that audience.

Improving the visualisation:
I would like to opt for bar charts to visualize this data, bar charts solve the problem of intersecting lines and will avoid confusion for the reader. I would also like to change the title to what the data tells us, rather than the title given by the article which is not true according to the data. Color can also be changed, since the US average rate is hardly visible in this visualization.
I will also be taking the state and its 2 years besides each othe rin bar chart to show th change in 2 years to the viewer.

#### Summary of my wireframes

These are the two wireframes/sketches I planned to use.

![Assignment31Final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112986330/191380169-f124df59-6a2e-44a8-9746-d82d21f53517.jpeg)

Here as you can see, I have made two similar sketches. As mentioned before, I have opted for bar graphs, but I was not sure how to show the national average rate in this. As you can see, in one of them, the US average is shown by a set of bars like the rest and in other it is shown as lines overlapping the bar.

#### Feedback for the wireframe/sketches
I got the opportunity to show my sketches to two individuals.

Individual 1: Student mid 20s
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
Individual 1 was quickly able to grasp what the visualisation was trying to show and where to focus in the visualisation.
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Individual 1 did not find anything confusing.
Out of the two visualisations shown, Individual preferred the second one as they thought the lines showing the US average were a bit confusing and not adding anything to the visualisation. 

Individual 2: Stduent mid 20s
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
Individual 2 was quickly able to grasp what the visualisation was trying to show and where to focus in the visualisation.
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Individual 2 did not find anything confusing.
Individual 2 suggested me to change the colors, as the colors were pretty close to each other and they weren't able to differentiate between the two colors in the sketch. Just like Individual 1, Individual 2 also preferred the second sketch as it was more clear.

####  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.
Both the individuals liked the sketches and didn't have many changes to suggest. 
The only change that I implemented from their suggestion was to change the colors. Blue and purple were looking similar, and they weren't able to differtiate between them. To solve this issue I decided to go with 2 contrasting colors: Shade of blue and shade of yellow.

#### Final Visualisation

Here I implemented bar graph to de-clutter the chaos created by line graph and so that the viewer can easily understand the change between 2 years.
After the feedback, 2 distinct colors were chosen which can be differentiated easily by all the readers.

Since I also wanted to draw the focus of the viewer on the US rate, I wanted to give them different colors to highlight them better. Unfortunately I wasn't able to do that on Flourish, hence I took that image and edited it outside the Flourish. I wanted to show how the national average has decrease, which is a good thing highlighted by green color. Hereby attaching the edited image which is what I wanted my final visualisation to be.

Here the red color indicates US Average Homelessness Rate in 2015 and green color indicates US Average Homelessness rate in 2017 (an improvement over previous year).
