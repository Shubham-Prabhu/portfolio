General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.

### Flourish Image: Part 2: Working with Flourish - Visualisation 2 

#### For this visualisation I have used area chart. Area chart shows a continuous change in the data throughout the years and hence looks better and clearer than both bar chat and grid of lines chart. I thought that in grid of line charts it as difficult for the viewer to connect the value to x-axis, a problem solved in the area chart.
#### For this visualisation, I also tried using column chart, pie chart, donut chart and steamgraph. Column chart was similar to bar chart with just a different alignment, pie chart cannot be used for this visualisation because the total pecentage is not going to be 100% and will vary from country to country, similar issue will arise for the donut chart. Steamgraph was a close call, but the visualisation seemed more confusing and crowded that the area chart. Hence, I finalised area chart for this visualisation.
