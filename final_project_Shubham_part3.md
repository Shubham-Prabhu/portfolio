#### Behind the Scenes
While researching for this project, I came across the fact that Obesity is now second to tobacco as a reason behind deaths in the United States. I was very surprised by this fact and decided to dig deeper into this. While analyzing the rising obesity across the country, I decided to analyse unhealthy diets consumed which lead to obesity. I also wanted to show various demographics who are more prone to consuming fast-food on a daily basis and hence I have added visualisations showing people by gender, race, income levels and state of residence to show the same. <br/>
