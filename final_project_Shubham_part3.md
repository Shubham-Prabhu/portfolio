#### Behind the Scenes
While researching for this project, I came across the fact that Obesity is now second to tobacco as a reason behind deaths in the United States. I was very surprised by this fact and decided to dig deeper into this. While analyzing the rising obesity across the country, I decided to analyse unhealthy diets consumed which lead to obesity. I also wanted to show various demographics who are more prone to consuming fast-food on a daily basis and hence I have added visualisations showing people by gender, race, income levels and state of residence to show the same. <br/>
Further I wanted to explain how higher consumption of fast-food leads to higher calorie intake and how the daily calorie intake in the country is increasing, which directly helps us understand why obesity is rising. <br/>
Call to action was pretty straight forward, even though we all know that one should minimize the fast-food consumption, a lot of people don't take it seriously and that's why I decided to go ahead with this subject and to state that this problem should not be taken lightly.

#### Changes from Part II
Comments from TA and the professor along with multiple interivews that I conducted really helped me with making the final story better.
1) Since obesity is a very personal subject, I wanted to make sure that the content or the images I use won't offend anyone. So I changes a few images, and chose very neutral images which won't hurt anyone. <br/>
2) I got the suggestion that many visualisations in the story were not really adding anything to the story (like the obesity rate across the states). So I decided to analyse people across various demographics who are more prone to obesity and consuming fast-food on a daily basis, added various visualisations showing the same and made sure that all the visualisations are part of the story that I am trying to tell. <br/>
3) In the tree map showing the leading causes behind deaths in the US, I got the feedback that the obesity related diseases were not being highlighted and that the "other" category was the biggest and was creating a distraction from the important information. To tackle this issue, I removed the other category and highlighted the obesity related diseases with one color and all the remaining diseases were given gray color. <br/>
4) Design Changes: Changed the graph of "adults consuming fast food on daily basis" to pictograph from bar chart. As I got the feedback that there are too many bar graphs in the story and something else might help me in making the story more interesting for the readers.

#### The audience
This was intended for audience between age group of 18 and 40 residing the US. Since most of the obesity related diseases don't show up until late, for people between 18 to 40 age it is the right time to act upon it and prevent them from occuring. To target this audience, I made sure to include various diet and consumption habits that they can relate to and which they consume as a part of their life.

#### Learnings from working through the process
One of the most important thing that I learnt was that the visualisations should easily bring the focus of the reader on what's important and should not distract the reader with unnecessary information. I used various colors along with gray to highlight important stuff that I want to show and I also removed a lot if stuff which I thought wasn't helping me with showing the information that I wanted to show and was just a distraction.
