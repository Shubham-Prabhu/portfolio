#### Behind the Scenes
While researching for this project, I came across the fact that Obesity is now second to tobacco as a reason behind deaths in the United States. I was very surprised by this fact and decided to dig deeper into this. While analyzing the rising obesity across the country, I decided to analyse unhealthy diets consumed which lead to obesity. I also wanted to show various demographics who are more prone to consuming fast-food on a daily basis and hence I have added visualisations showing people by gender, race, income levels and state of residence to show the same. <br/>
Further I wanted to explain how higher consumption of fast-food leads to higher calorie intake and how the daily calorie intake in the country is increasing, which directly helps us understand why obesity is rising. <br/>
Call to action was pretty straight forward, even though we all know that one should minimize the fast-food consumption, a lot of people don't take it seriously and that's why I decided to go ahead with this subject and to state that this problem should not be taken lightly.

#### Changes from Part II
Comments from TA and the professor along with multiple interivews that I conducted really helped me with making the final story better.
1) Since obesity is a very personal subject, I wanted to make sure that the content or the images I use won't offend anyone. So I changes a few images, and chose very neutral images which won't hurt anyone. <br/>
2) I got the suggestion that many visualisations in the story were not really adding anything to the story (like the obesity rate across the states). So I decided to analyse people across various demographics who are more prone to obesity and consuming fast-food on a daily basis, added various visualisations showing the same and made sure that all the visualisations are part of the story that I am trying to tell. <br/>
3) In the tree map showing the leading causes behind deaths in the US, I got the feedback that the obesity related diseases were not being highlighted and that the "other" category was the biggest and was creating a distraction from the important information. To tackle this issue, I removed the other category and highlighted the obesity related diseases with one color and all the remaining diseases were given gray color. <br/>
