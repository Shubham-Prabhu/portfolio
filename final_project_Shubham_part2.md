### Part II: Final project

#### Wireframes and storyboards

I have used Shorthand to create a draft for the story I want to tell. I have also used Tableau and Flourish for data visualisations.

Currently since this is just a draft, I haven't mentioned all the references in the Shorthand, I will be adding all the references and the resources that I used before submitting the final project.

#### User research and interviews
