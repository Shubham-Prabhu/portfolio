### Part II: Final project

#### Wireframes and storyboards

I have used Shorthand to create a draft for the story I want to tell. I have also used Tableau and Flourish for data visualisations.

<br />

Currently since this is just a draft, I haven't mentioned all the references in the Shorthand, I will be adding all the references and the resources that I used before submitting the final project.

#### User research and interviews

##### User Research Protocol

The target audience you hope to reach with your story: <br />
- Adults residing in the US. <br />

Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview:
- I looked around for adults who currently reside in the US so that they can understand the issue better and give me the required feedback. <br />

##### Interview script
My purpose of conducting the user interviews was to make sure that the point I am trying to make is easily reaching the intended audience, the audience understands why this issue is important and if they are convinced with the reasoning behind call to action. Also, since obesity is a sensitive topic, I also wanted to make sure that the images, titles and the wordings used in Story line are not offending anyone.  <br />

Research Questions for Interview: <br />
1) Do you find the Title or the Title Page Picture offensive? <br />
2) Are the visualisations easy to understand and convey the facts mentioned? <br />
3) Is the background described for the issue effective enough? OR Does the background make you aware of the issue I am talking about? <br />
4) Is the story compelling and clear enough to understand and is the story flow making sense to you? <br />
5) Is the call for action effective for you to act on it? <br />

##### The findings from your interviews 
I interviewed 3 individuals.  2 were students in mid 20s and 1 was Software Developer in early 30s. <br />

1) Do you find the Title or the Title Page Picture offensive? <br />
- One of them said, "Since the title and focal point of your project is obesity, it makes sense to add pictures and titles related to obesity and it ideally shouldn't offend anyone". <br />
- All three of them had similar views on this and assured me that no one will be offended by this. <br />

2) Are the visualisations easy to understand and convey the facts mentioned? <br />
- One of the interviewees mentioned that from the first visualisation it seems that "others" is the biggest category, and makes it difficult to understand how other categories related to obesity are related. <br />
- Second interviewee suggested to totally removing the "others" category as it making the visualisation more confusing. <br />
- Third interviewee also echoed similar concerns regarding the tree map, that is bit confusing and diseases related to obesity are not being focussed upon. <br />
- All three were satisified with the remaining visualisations and found all of them very clear to understand. <br />

3) Is the background described for the issue effective enough? OR Does the background make you aware of the issue I am talking about? <br />
- All the 3 interviewees found the background very compelling to bring focus to the issue I want to display. <br />
- One of the interviewees mentioned that relation between the 12 fatal diseases mentioned and obesity is not strong enough, they also suggested some more infromation about these diseases are directly related to obesity will help readers understand the issue better. <br />
- The second user was really surprised by the fact that nearly 1/3rd of the population is defined as overweight/obese in the United States.

4) Is the story compelling and clear enough to understand and is the story flow making sense to you? <br />
- One of the interviewees mentioned that the format of starting by giving the background, then stating the reasoning and data for it and then concluding it was a good way to present this issue. <br />
- The Second interviewee mentioned that one thing did not make sense while looking at the flow, they asked why the obesity related to races is mentioned, and if it is important then why further information about it is missing. <br />
- The third interviewee thought overall the story flow was good, but mentioned that they did not understand the relevance of obesity by state visualisation in the story line and what the author was trying to say about it. <br />
- Overall, all three mentioned that they would highly rate the flow of the story, barring a 1-2 confusing things in it.

5) Is the call for action effective for you to act on it? <br />
- All the three interviewees mentioned that the story was effective enough for them to understand the gravity of the issue and hence call to action made sense to them.<br />
- One of the interviewees mentioned that they would like to see more actions that are needed and if there are any steps taken by the government or other prominent organisation to tackle this issue.

##### Changes I plan on implementing to my visualizations next week to address the issues identified 
After carefully listening to feedback of the 3 interviewees and also the feedback that I receieved in the class, I have realised that some changes are needed to make this story line even better, less confusing and more compelling to the intended audience. <br />

1) The first visualisation (the tree map) needs to be modified. <br />
I plan to remove the "others" from the visualisation as it is not important to convey the point I am trying to make, and removing it wont' really affect the visualisation or reduce the truthfulness of the visualisation. <br />
The other change I want to make is highlight or color all the diseases related to obesity with same color, so that I can easiy draw reader's focus to them.<br />

2) I also would like to make a more compelling statement as to how these diseases that I have highlighted have obesity as one of the major factors as their root cause, this will help me make the reader understand how obesity is the 2nd highest reason for deaths in the United States. <br />
